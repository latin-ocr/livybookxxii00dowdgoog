INTRODUOTION.

MATERIALS FOR THE SEOOND PUNIo WAR.

Livv’s lost second decade (xa—xx.) embraced the
history 01 the First Punic War. The third decade (xxl.

—mb extending from Β. 0. sla-201, includes the
Second Punic War, on which the following authore, 10

addition 10 Livy, are our main authorities: Polybius

no. 167, Silius Italicus an. 77, Appian an. 140, Dio '

Cassius (frags.) ab. 180, Zonaras an. 1118, besides the
biographical notices of Nepos Β. 0. 44 and 01 Plutarch
an. 80, and the epitomes 01 Florus an. 115, Eutropius
an. 361, and Orosiirs A. 0. 416. From this it follows
that all contemporary documents¹ have perished, Poly-
bius not having been born till probably 00. 204. The
Romans 01 Livy's day were unoritical and did not re-
quire a statement 01 authorities for his facts, but rather
the pleasure 01 00 attractiva style. Hence Livy does not
often inform us on what procis his accounts are based.
