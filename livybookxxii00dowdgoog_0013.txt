, On the one hand it may be urged that the Greek historiari
is only once named (30, 45, 4)-Polybiaa haudquaquam

eperaeadm auctam But it is certain that in the next
two decades Livy follows him closely, so that it seems
unlikely that Livy should have overlooked his important
third book on the Hannibalis War. Besides, we find
remarkable coincidences in language as well as subject-
matter between the two. Of course our author having
to treet in this decade samuch on home, as opposed
to foreign, affairs would naturally reeur most frequently
to the Roman Annalists‚ whereas in the fourth and fifth
decades his attention was directed much more to the
affairs of Greeee and the East Unquestionably, as I
have tried to show in my notes on Bks xxr. and mr, the
treatment of the Hannibalis War is based on two distinct
sources, one foreign the other Roman. But notwith-
standing the discrepancies, which might easily arise from
confusing the two, it seems perfectly clear to my mind,
on comparing the language of Livy with that of Polybius ¹,
that the foreign authority was Polybius. Nitzsoh¹ and
others, however, explain the obvious agreement between
the Greek and the Roman by the fact that they are both
following common authorities, which in the case of Bks
xxr. and xxn. would be Fabius Pictor and Silenus,
through the medium of (laelius Antipater⁸, while for
23-30 Livy’s 'authority was probably Valerius Antias.
