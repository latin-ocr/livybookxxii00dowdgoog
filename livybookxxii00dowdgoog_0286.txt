‘¹ Mr Dowdall has given a remarkable proof of his command
over Greek prose by epitomising the history ot Persia—from
Menander to the Saraoen Conquest-in sortysour pagee· of ex-
cellent Greek. The narrative might easily pass for a continuation
by Anien of his Anabucis, written aiter an interval devoted to
a closer study of the classica] models.”—R. G. Jrnn, Professor oi
Greek, Glasgow.

“Mr DowdaH’a sketch ot Persian history, written ¹in Greek,
I read with much interest and admiration....The compositionis
both spirited and idiomatio.¹’-O. Murrum, Dean oi Ely.

little roolf—Spectator, Jan. 14, 1882.
