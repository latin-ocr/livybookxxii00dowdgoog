this war, while he singles out two Greeks who were in
Hannibal's camp, Silenus and Sosilus the Lacedaemo
nian (who taught Hannibal Greek), as also Philinus,
who accompanied Hannibal, and was as favonrable to
the Carthagiuians as Fabius was to the Romans. Livy
refers to Silenus 26, 49, 3, and Cicero Div. 1, 2401010οε
him, saying diliyentt'aaime rea Hannibalis menatae
eat. They are both quoted by Polybius, who (3, 20, 5),
however, censuras Sosilus for his credulity. Other con·
temporaries of the war were Fabius Pictor (whose
valuable history is cited by Polybius, Dionysius and
Livy 3 cf. 22, 7, 4, 01. 11). 57, 5), and Cincius Alimentus,
whom our author likewise consulted (21, 38, 3). 0010
(ac. 201) 10 1110411000 5th Bks 01 his Origines re·
lated the history of the First and Second Punic Wars3
but Livy does not quote that work, nor yet the history of
Hemina, who related the Second Punic War in his 4111
Bk. Livy, however, recognises the value of the Annals
of Calpurnius Piso and those 01 Αο11100, translated by
Claudius (Quadrigarius 1), 25, 39, m. But the authors
most frequently cited by Livy are 0001100 Antipater¹
(01 21, 38, 7), and Valerius Antias (35 times), anlius’
chief authority being Silenus, as in the case 01 the
dream (21, 22, 6, 01. Oic's quotation from 0001100).
Livy quotes Caelius eleven times in the third decade,

and he undoubtedly followed him 1022, 5,·8 , 3, 11 (010.
Div. l, 35), 0, 1, ch. 49, 50, 11, 51, 2¹. The great
question iu disputa is whether Livy direotly used

Polybius’ work. Lachmann, Peter and others main-
tain that he did , Nitzsch and others that he did not.
